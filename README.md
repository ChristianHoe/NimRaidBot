# NimRaidBot

This telegram bot for Pokemon Go is used by our local group. It is using .Net core and MariaDB on a linux system.

Main focus is on simplicity for the normal group member.

A second telegram bot is handling all the indivual interactions like report raids, configure user name, ...

Theoretically there exists an map importer to report automatically raids and pokemon.

As long as I do not know anyone using this bot be careful. There is no automatic database update strategy. A lot of functionallity/configuration can be done only in the database.

If you like to see the bot(s) in action, feel free to contact me. The bot can handle multiple raid groups at once, so I can setup a test group.
